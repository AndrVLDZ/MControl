Remote control of some DAW functions.
Server runs on your PC or laptop with windows, you must set the port to start the server and the server ip will be displayed.
Sender runs on the android phone using QPython3L or Python on Termux. You can connect to the server using its port and ip.
Now the sender is written to connect to 2 servers, later I will rewrite it to connect to an unlimited number of servers.
This will allow you to run various things on different devices at the same time, according to my measurements, the desynchronization is about 5 milliseconds.
